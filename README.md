- show/hide cieties on the map (when clicked information about name and population is shown) 
- show/hide tourist attraction on the map (when clicked information this attraction is shown) 
- when clicking city marker only earthquakes that can affect this city are shown
- when clicking earthquake only cities that could be affected are shown
- when clicking tourist attraction only attractions that are in the same continent are shown
